Not Working Exactly as planned:
-the large progress bar in the tab pages fills, but the small progress bar does not fill at the same time
-"time elapsed" in info tab is not yet implemented
-a lof of pages are blank... seeders, peers, speed etc contain no info


Where the info is being pulled from:
.transfernet files have information  stored in them so you need to use the copies of them that i provided
